## The Problem

Your AI system has a safety guard. You update it. How do you know it got better — not just in aggregate, but across every category, every language, every attack type?

How do you stop a 3am PR from shipping a guard that passes unit tests but silently drops recall on Farsi violence detection by 12%?

You don't. Not without sea-guard.

---

## What It Does

sea-guard is a Python framework that compares two safety guards — your current one (baseline) and any new version or alternative (candidate) — on labeled datasets. It produces reproducible, auditable evaluation reports and blocks CI merges when safety metrics regress.

```
Dataset → [Baseline Guard] ─┐
                             ├→ Metrics → Report → CI Gate
        → [Candidate Guard] ─┘
```

**One command to run a full evaluation:**

```bash
pip install sea-guard
guardbench compare --baseline regex --candidate openai --dataset dataset/sample.csv
guardbench report --run latest --open
guardbench gate --config gate.json   # exits 1 if safety regresses
```

---

## Key Features

**For developers and MLOps teams:**

- Plug in any guard — regex, OpenAI Moderation API, Llama Guard, or your own via a simple Python ABC
- Slice-level metrics per `(category × language)` — catches regressions invisible to aggregate numbers
- Full CI integration — `guardbench gate` exits non-zero on regression, blocks the merge
- Run history in SQLite — every evaluation is tagged with `run_id`, dataset SHA, and git commit for full reproducibility
- Auto-tuning — finds the highest-recall threshold per slice that keeps FPR under your target

**For AI/ML leads:**

- Compare any two guards side-by-side — not just your own variants, but OpenAI Moderation vs Llama Guard vs your fine-tuned model
- Statistical significance testing via McNemar's test — know if a difference is real or noise
- LLM-as-judge mode — use Claude or GPT-4o as a second opinion on unlabeled data
- Interactive HTML reports with threshold sweep charts

**For compliance and legal teams:**

- Every run is reproducible and auditable — `run_id` + dataset SHA + git commit = full traceability
- Built-in EU AI Act and NIST AI RMF compliance section in every report
- Gate configuration (`gate.json`) is a machine-readable safety policy — version-controlled, reviewable, auditable
- Wilson score confidence intervals on all recall and FPR metrics

## EU AI Act — August 2026

The EU AI Act requires high-risk AI systems to demonstrate accuracy, robustness, and ongoing performance monitoring. Full enforcement begins **August 2026**.

sea-guard generates the technical documentation your compliance team needs:

| EU AI Act Requirement | How sea-guard Addresses It |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Art. 9 — Risk management system | Documented evaluation runs with reproducible metrics |
| Art. 15 — Accuracy and robustness | Slice-level metrics across categories and languages |
| Art. 17 — Quality management | CI gate blocks regressions before deployment |
| Annex IV — Technical documentation | Automated audit-ready HTML reports per run |

---

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install sea-guard
cd your-project
guardbench init                    # creates config.yaml, gate.json, sample dataset
guardbench compare \
  --baseline regex \
  --candidate openai \
  --dataset dataset/sample.csv
guardbench report --run latest --open
guardbench gate --config gate.json
```

---

## Dashboard

After running evaluations, view an interactive multi-run dashboard:

```bash
guardbench dashboard
```

Opens `report/dashboard.html` in your browser. The dashboard is also auto-rebuilt every time you run `guardbench report`.

**Four tabs:**
- **Overview** — run history table with F1, recall, FPR, McNemar p-value, and pass/fail gate badges. Click any row to drill in.
- **Run Detail** — baseline vs candidate metric cards (with Wilson CIs), per-slice recall/FPR breakdown, and a 200-row sample results table. Strict/Lenient toggle.
- **Trends** — line charts of recall, F1, FPR, and McNemar p-value over all runs (chronological). p-value chart uses log scale with a p=0.05 reference line.
- **Compare** — pick any two runs from dropdowns; see a delta table for every metric with green/red improvement/regression arrows.

## Plug In Any Guard

```python
from guardbench.core.guard import Guard, GuardResult

class MyGuard(Guard):
    name = "my-guard"
    version = "1.0.0"

    def predict(self, text: str, **meta) -> GuardResult:
        # your logic here
        is_unsafe = "bomb" in text.lower()
        return GuardResult(
            prediction="flag" if is_unsafe else "pass",
            score=0.9 if is_unsafe else 0.1,
            latency_ms=5,
        )

# register and use immediately
from guardbench.core.registry import register
register("my-guard", MyGuard)
```

Then run:
```bash
guardbench compare --baseline regex --candidate my-guard --dataset data.csv
```

---

## CI Integration

Add to your GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- name: Install sea-guard
  run: pip install sea-guard

- name: Run safety evaluation
  run: guardbench compare --baseline regex --candidate ${{ env.CANDIDATE_GUARD }} --dataset dataset/eval.csv

- name: Build report
  run: guardbench report --run latest

- name: Safety gate
  run: guardbench gate --config gate.json   # fails build if metrics regress

- name: Upload report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: safety-report
    path: report/
```

---

## Gate Configuration

`gate.json` is your machine-readable safety policy. Check it into version control.

```json
{
  "mode": "strict",
  "global_thresholds": {
    "max_fpr": 0.02,
    "min_recall": 0.90,
    "max_latency_p99_ms": 500,
    "min_f1": 0.80
  },
  "slices": {
    "violence/fa": { "min_recall": 0.85 },
    "self_harm/*": { "min_recall": 0.95 }
  },
  "comparison": {
    "max_recall_regression": 0.02,
    "max_fpr_increase": 0.02
  },
  "on_failure": "block"
}
```
